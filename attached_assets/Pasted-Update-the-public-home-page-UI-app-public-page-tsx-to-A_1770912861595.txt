Update the public home page UI (app/(public)/page.tsx) to (A) add 3 premium image+text banners, (B) fix feature cards text alignment/spacing, and (C) refine pricing cards behavior + CTA button sizing. Keep the existing Deep Teal design system and layout structure. Do not add new features beyond what’s listed.

A) ADD 3 PREMIUM IMAGE BANNERS (image + text overlay)
Goal: 3 reusable promo banners with clean education-themed images and readable text overlay.
- Create /public/images/banners/ if missing.
- Use these image paths (create placeholders if real images not available yet):
  1) /public/images/banners/banner-worksheets.jpg
  2) /public/images/banners/banner-drills.jpg
  3) /public/images/banners/banner-live.jpg
- Implement a reusable component PromoBanner (either inside page.tsx or app/_components/PromoBanner.tsx):
  Props: title, subtitle, ctaText, ctaHref, imageSrc
- Banner styling:
  - rounded-2xl, subtle border, soft shadow
  - background image with dark/teal gradient overlay so text is always readable
  - no loud colors, premium calm look
  - responsive: desktop text left, mobile stacked
- Place banners:
  1) Under Hero and above “Everything you need to excel” section
  2) Between feature cards section and pricing section
  3) Above pricing section OR immediately before pricing heading (choose whichever looks cleaner)
- Banner placeholder content:
  Banner 1: “Start with Worksheets that Build Mastery”
    subtitle: “Foundational → Skill Builder → Mastery, aligned to curriculum.”
    CTA: “Explore Worksheets” -> /worksheets
  Banner 2: “Merit Drills: Rapid Reinforcement”
    subtitle: “Timed practice, XP rewards, and smarter revision.”
    CTA: “Try Merit Drills” -> /drills
  Banner 3: “Live Sessions that Move the Needle”
    subtitle: “1:1 or small batches — focused, outcome-driven.”
    CTA: “Book a Session” -> /sessions

B) FIX “EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO EXCEL” FEATURE CARDS ALIGNMENT (no vague gaps)
Problem: title/description spacing and alignment feels uneven.
Fix requirements:
- Keep the two-tone card design (top white area for icon, bottom tinted area for text).
- Make all 3 cards use identical internal vertical rhythm:
  - Icon row: fixed height container (e.g., h-20) with consistent padding (p-6)
  - Bottom text area: px-6 pt-5 pb-6
  - Title: same font size and margin (mt-0), consistent line height
  - Description: use consistent line height (leading-7), and set a min-height for the description block so all cards align visually.
- Remove any accidental margins/padding causing uneven empty spaces.
- Ensure the left padding of title and description aligns perfectly under each other for all cards.

C) PRICING SECTION: REMOVE AUTO-HIGHLIGHT, FIX CTA BUTTON “EMPTY SPACE”
Issues:
1) No card should be highlighted by default (the green border on PRO should NOT appear on page load).
   - Borders/active state should appear ONLY on user interaction (click/select).
2) CTA buttons still look like they have “empty space”.
Fix requirements:
- Remove the default “featured” styling/border on PRO card.
- Implement interactive selection (client-side only):
  - On click of a pricing card (or its CTA), that card becomes “selected”
  - Only the selected card shows a border highlight (using var(--primary) border)
  - Default: no selected card
- CTA buttons:
  - Make them either true full-width (recommended): w-full, h-12, justify-center, text centered
  - Remove excessive horizontal padding that makes it feel empty
  - Ensure identical button size across all 3 cards
  - All pricing CTAs should be dark primary style (bg var(--primary), text var(--on-primary))
- Keep pricing content as placeholder; we will rewrite later.

FILES TO EDIT:
- app/(public)/page.tsx (primary)
- Create PromoBanner component (page.tsx or app/_components/PromoBanner.tsx)
- Add banner images (placeholders ok) in /public/images/banners/

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not change global token system.
- Do not introduce new dependencies.
- Do not clutter the page; keep spacing premium and consistent.
- Ensure headings and section spacing remain clean and aligned.

After changes:
- Output which files were created/modified.
- Show final code for:
  - PromoBanner component
  - Feature cards section JSX
  - Pricing section JSX (including selection logic)
