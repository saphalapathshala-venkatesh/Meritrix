Upgrade the student subject worksheets page UI (/learn/worksheets/[subjectId]) to a premium tiered layout.

DO NOT change Prisma schema.
DO NOT change business logic.
DO NOT modify access logic.
Only improve grouping + presentation.

GOAL:
Inside each chapter card, worksheets must be clearly divided into 3 premium tier sections:
1) Foundational
2) Skill Builder
3) Mastery

Each tier section must include:
- Tier title
- Small subtle icon (minimal, monochrome)
- Worksheet count (e.g., Foundational (3))
- Thin divider line separating tiers
- Clean worksheet rows
- No excessive spacing
- No loud colors

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:

1) Group worksheets by tier in this strict order:
   foundational → skill_builder → mastery

2) Mapping for display:
   foundational -> "Foundational"
   skill_builder -> "Skill Builder"
   mastery -> "Mastery"

3) Add a small inline SVG icon per tier:
   - Foundational: simple book icon
   - Skill Builder: upward arrow or tool icon
   - Mastery: star or crown icon
Icons must be subtle and use current text color (no bright colors).

4) Tier header layout:
   - Flex row
   - Icon (16px)
   - Title
   - Count in muted color
   - Space-between alignment
   - Very thin divider below (border-t with opacity 10–15%)

Example visual structure:

-----------------------------------
Chapter Name
-----------------------------------

[Icon] Foundational (3)
-----------------------------------
Worksheet row
Worksheet row
Worksheet row

[Icon] Skill Builder (2)
-----------------------------------
Worksheet row
Worksheet row

[Icon] Mastery (1)
-----------------------------------
Worksheet row

5) Hide any tier section that has zero worksheets.

6) Spacing rules:
   - No large empty vertical gaps.
   - Consistent padding across tiers.
   - Keep chapter card compact but readable.
   - Ensure text wrapping does not break layout.

7) Ensure seed data uses exactly:
   foundational
   skill_builder
   mastery

If seed currently uses other variants, normalize them.

8) Maintain current worksheet row behavior:
   - FREE badge
   - LOCKED state
   - Completion checkbox
   - Download/View button

9) Keep UI premium:
   - No gradient backgrounds
   - No heavy borders
   - No shadow overload
   - Use subtle separators only

OUTPUT:
- Updated JSX for chapter card
- Confirm tiers render in correct order
- Confirm worksheet counts appear correctly
- Confirm layout has no overflow or alignment issues
