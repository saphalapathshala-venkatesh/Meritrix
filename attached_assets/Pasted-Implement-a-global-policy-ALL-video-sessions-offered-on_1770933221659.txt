Implement a global policy: ALL video sessions offered on this platform are 100% ONLINE LIVE only (no onsite / in-person sessions). This must be communicated clearly in UI + Terms, and enforced in data/admin so we never accidentally create “offline” sessions.

Constraints:
- Do not break existing auth, worksheets, purchases, Razorpay, or Vedic pass work-in-progress.
- Keep UI premium, calm, and clean (no red warnings).
- Make changes minimal, additive, and safe.

A) Data & Enforcement (minimal)
1) Update Prisma schema:
   - In LiveSession model add:
     - mode String @default("ONLINE_LIVE")
   - (Optional but preferred) add enum:
     - enum SessionMode { ONLINE_LIVE }
     - LiveSession.mode SessionMode @default(ONLINE_LIVE)
   - Do NOT add any offline mode.
2) Run migration and regenerate Prisma client.
3) Update any LiveSession creation logic (admin APIs/forms) to always set mode = ONLINE_LIVE.
   - Remove/disable any “location” or “venue” fields for live sessions if they exist.
   - Ensure meetingUrl remains the only delivery method.

B) Admin UI hardening
1) In Admin → Live Sessions create/edit:
   - Remove any UI that implies offline/onsite (location input, “in-person” labels).
   - Add a small helper note near meetingUrl:
     - “Sessions are Online LIVE only. Share Zoom/Meet link here.”
   - If meetingUrl is empty, show a calm validation message (do not allow publishing/activating without meetingUrl for sessions that are scheduled soon).
2) Ensure existing sessions without meetingUrl are still editable (don’t crash), but show a “Missing link” badge and prevent activation until added.

C) Student UI communication (clear, premium)
1) Wherever we show session booking / session details / checkout:
   - Add a consistent “Delivery mode” line:
     - “Delivery: Online LIVE (Remote Only)”
   - Do this on:
     - Session booking page(s)
     - Session detail modal/card (if exists)
     - Booking confirmation screen
     - Receipt/summary card after purchase (if shown)
2) Add a small “Online LIVE only” pill/badge in the session cards list header (subtle theme color).

D) Terms & Conditions (global)
1) Add a single global terms section (reusable component/modal) that states:
   - “All sessions are conducted strictly Online LIVE. We do not offer onsite/in-person classes.”
   - “Students must have stable internet, a device, and be able to join via the provided meeting link.”
2) Add a link “Terms & Session Policy” on all session booking/purchase pages.
3) If there is a checkbox acceptance gate for any session purchase flow:
   - Keep it, but ensure the checkbox text is global (applies to all sessions, not only Vedic).
   - Store acceptance in DB for future audit:
     - Add to LiveBooking (or purchase record) fields:
       - termsVersion String @default("v1")
       - termsAcceptedAt DateTime?
     - Store only once per booking/purchase event.

E) UX copy (exact phrasing)
Use consistent text everywhere:
- “Online LIVE (Remote Only)”
- “No onsite / in-person sessions are offered.”

F) Verification
After implementation, verify:
- Admin cannot create any “offline” session mode (only ONLINE_LIVE exists).
- Session pages clearly communicate online-only.
- Nothing breaks on existing sessions or bookings.
- Booking/purchase flows still work.

Deliverables:
- Updated schema + migration
- Admin live session UI updated
- Student session pages updated with “Online LIVE only” messaging
- Global terms/policy component added and reused
- List of all files changed at the end
