Build Admin MVP for Meritrix. This is Phase B after worksheets.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change student UI.
- Do NOT change purchase logic.
- Do NOT change schema except if absolutely needed (avoid migrations).
- All admin routes must be protected by requireAdmin() at layout level.
- Keep UI premium and minimal, consistent with current design system.

Admin Pages to Create:

1) /app/(admin)/admin/page.tsx
- Admin home dashboard with quick links:
  Users, Content, Packages, Coupons
- Optional: small stats cards (total users, total worksheets published)

2) /app/(admin)/admin/users/page.tsx
Features:
- List users (paginated or simple list)
- Search by email
- Block/unblock toggle (updates user.isBlocked)
- Delete user (confirm modal)
- Optional: Set new password (admin reset)

API routes:
- GET /api/admin/users?search=...
- POST /api/admin/users/block (userId, isBlocked)
- DELETE /api/admin/users/delete (userId)
- POST /api/admin/users/reset-password (userId, newPassword) optional

3) /app/(admin)/admin/content/page.tsx
Content Management:
- Tabs or sections:
  Grades, Subjects, Chapters, Worksheets

CRUD operations required:
Grades:
- create/edit/delete: name, sortOrder
Subjects:
- create/edit/delete: gradeId, name, slug, price, sortOrder
Chapters:
- create/edit/delete: subjectId, name, slug, sortOrder
Worksheets:
- create/edit/delete:
  chapterId, title, slug, tier, isFree, isPublished, pdfUrl, answerUrl, sortOrder

Tier enforcement (UI validation):
Only allow: foundational, skill_builder, mastery

API routes:
- /api/admin/grades (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- /api/admin/subjects (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- /api/admin/chapters (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- /api/admin/worksheets (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

4) /app/(admin)/admin/packages/page.tsx
- Create package: name, slug, price, isActive
- Select subjects included (multi-select)
- Edit and deactivate
API: /api/admin/packages (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

5) /app/(admin)/admin/coupons/page.tsx
- Create coupon: code, discountPercent, maxUses, minAmount, expiresAt, isActive
- Toggle active
API: /api/admin/coupons (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Implementation Details:
- Use Prisma directly in API routes.
- Validate inputs with Zod.
- Use clean toast/error messages (no alerts).
- Use confirm modal for deletes.
- Keep list tables aligned, no layout gaps.

Output:
- List created pages and API routes.
- Confirm admin can create a worksheet, mark isFree=true, isPublished=true, and it instantly appears to students.
- Confirm blocking a user logs them out on next request (via requireUser clearing session).
