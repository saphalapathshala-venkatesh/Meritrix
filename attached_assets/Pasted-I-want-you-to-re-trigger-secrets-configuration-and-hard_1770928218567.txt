I want you to re-trigger secrets configuration and harden the app so it runs safely without recurring env/webhook issues.

Goal:
1) Make the project explicitly depend on these 3 env vars and fail fast with clear errors if missing:
   - RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
   - RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET
   - RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET
2) Ensure every place that uses Razorpay reads these env vars through a single validated config module.
3) Ensure pages/components that depend on payment data do not crash when env is missing (show a polite “Payments not configured” UI for admins/dev).
4) Ensure webhook works reliably in dev and is not blocked by middleware.
5) Ensure signature verification is correct and consistent.

Important:
- Do NOT rotate API keys. Keep the same RAZORPAY_KEY_ID and RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET I already have.
- I already created a new webhook in Razorpay dashboard; the only thing that must match is RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
- Keep the existing purchase logic and DB models as-is.

Implementation steps:
A) Create `lib/config/env.ts`:
   - Read process.env values
   - Validate they exist (throw a clean error message that lists missing keys)
   - Export `razorpayConfig = { keyId, keySecret, webhookSecret }`

B) Update all Razorpay backend code to import from `lib/config/env.ts` only.
   - `lib/payments/razorpay.ts`
   - payment create-order routes
   - payment verify routes
   - webhook route

C) Update all frontend Razorpay checkout code:
   - It must only use `keyId` from server response, never from env directly.
   - If create-order returns 500 because env is missing, show a calm toast/modal “Payments are temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.”

D) Add a safe health endpoint:
   - GET /api/payments/health
   - Returns { razorpayConfigured: boolean, missing: string[] }
   - Does NOT expose secrets.
   - Use this endpoint in admin dashboard (optional) to show “Payments: Configured / Not Configured”.

E) Make sure middleware does not block:
   - /api/webhooks/razorpay
   - /api/payments/*

F) Confirm build stability:
   - No runtime errors if env is missing; only payment routes fail with clear messages.
   - Non-payment parts (worksheets/admin) still work.

G) After changes, list the files updated and confirm the 3 secrets will be requested again by Replit if not present.

Finally:
- Do NOT change UI styling except small error states.
- Confirm that a successful payment results in paymentStatus=SUCCESS and unlocks content as before.
