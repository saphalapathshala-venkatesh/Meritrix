TASK: Fix Vercel build error: "Module not found: Can't resolve '@/app/generated/prisma'" in lib/prisma.ts, with ZERO feature changes.

CONTEXT:
- Current project uses Prisma.
- Vercel build fails because code imports PrismaClient from "@/app/generated/prisma" (custom output path).
- On Vercel, Prisma client should be imported from "@prisma/client" (default output).
- We will NOT add DATABASE_URL now. We only want build to succeed on Vercel first; DB URL will be configured on Vercel after deployment.
- Do NOT change any UI, routes, auth, payments, or business logic.

GOALS (STRICT):
1) Update prisma/schema.prisma:
   - Remove the generator output setting so Prisma uses default output.
   - Keep: generator client { provider = "prisma-client-js" }
   - Delete ONLY the `output = ".../app/generated/prisma"` line (or any custom output line).
   - Do not alter models/enums/relations/fields.

2) Update lib/prisma.ts:
   - Replace any import like:
     import { PrismaClient } from "@/app/generated/prisma"
     OR "@/app/generated/prisma/client"
     with:
     import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"
   - Keep PrismaPg adapter usage and current singleton pattern intact.
   - Do not change runtime logic; only fix the import path.

3) Ensure dependencies are correct:
   - Ensure "@prisma/client" is present in dependencies and "prisma" is in devDependencies.
   - If missing, install them (do not upgrade major versions unnecessarily).

4) Add a Vercel-safe build hook (minimal):
   - Update package.json scripts so Vercel can generate Prisma client during build.
   - Set:
     "build": "prisma generate && next build"
   - Do NOT run db push/migrate in build (we will add DB later).
   - Do NOT remove existing scripts; just adjust build safely.

5) Repo hygiene:
   - Ensure prisma generated artifacts are not committed (keep .gitignore intact).
   - Do not create app/generated/prisma folder usage anywhere.

6) Verification:
   - Run locally in Replit:
     - npm run build
   - If build fails due to missing DATABASE_URL, then:
     - Modify build script to:
       "build": "prisma generate && next build"
     - And ensure prisma generate does NOT require DB connection.
   - Confirm the previous module-not-found error is gone.

DELIVERABLE:
- Only commit the minimal set of changes required to fix the import/output issue and allow Vercel build to pass.
- Provide a short summary listing changed files and what changed.

FILES LIKELY TO TOUCH:
- prisma/schema.prisma
- lib/prisma.ts
- package.json
- package-lock.json (if updated)

DO NOT:
- Change any feature behavior
- Change database schema (models/enums)
- Add DATABASE_URL anywhere
- Touch pages/components unless required for the import fix
