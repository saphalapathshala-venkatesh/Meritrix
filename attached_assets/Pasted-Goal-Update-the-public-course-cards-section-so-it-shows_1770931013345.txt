Goal: Update the public “course cards” section so it shows both:

Subject course cards (existing)

Grade package cards (new demo) — “All subjects included combo”

Instructions:

Locate the section/page where the current subject demo cards are rendered (the same section shown in the screenshot).

Do NOT change navbar, banners, auth, or payments.

Only change this course card section.

Create a unified data model for cards:

Each card is either:

type: "SUBJECT" or

type: "GRADE_PACKAGE"

For SUBJECT cards, keep existing fields: subjectName, gradeName, mrp, price, currency="$".

For GRADE_PACKAGE cards, add fields:

gradeName (ex: "Grade 6")

includesLabel (always: "All Subjects Included")

mrp, price, currency="$"

subjectCount (optional, if available; otherwise omit)

Render two kinds of card headers:

SUBJECT: badge “SUBJECT COURSE”

GRADE_PACKAGE: badge “GRADE PACKAGE”
Use the same badge styling.

Card body layout (keep current clean design):

Title:

SUBJECT: show subjectName (ex: “Mathematics”)

GRADE_PACKAGE: show gradeName (ex: “Grade 6 Combo” or just “Grade 6”)

Subtitle line:

SUBJECT: “Grade: Grade 6”

GRADE_PACKAGE: “All Subjects Included”

Pricing row:

Show MRP label, strike-through MRP value

Show discount pill like “38% OFF”

Show big discounted price below (same as now)

CTA:

Button text:

SUBJECT: “Buy Now”

GRADE_PACKAGE: “Buy Grade Pack”

Keep button styling identical

Add demo grade package cards (at least 2) alongside existing subject cards:

Example demo data:

Grade 6 package: MRP $149.00, Price $99.00

Grade 7 package: MRP $159.00, Price $109.00

Make sure the discount % is computed from MRP and Price:

discountPct = round(((mrp - price) / mrp) * 100)

Format money with two decimals (e.g., $99.00)

Ensure the section remains premium:

Same spacing/padding as current subject cards

No new background colors

No extra text blocks

No layout shifts across themes

Do NOT connect grade package cards to payment yet.

On click, just show a calm toast or modal:

“Grade packs purchase flow will be enabled next.”

Keep this consistent with the site’s design.

After implementation:

Confirm visually that both card types render cleanly.

Share the final screenshot output from the updated section.
