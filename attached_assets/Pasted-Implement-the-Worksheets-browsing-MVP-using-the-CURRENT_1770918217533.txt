Implement the Worksheets browsing MVP using the CURRENT Prisma schema (do NOT assume model names — inspect prisma/schema.prisma first).

GOAL UX:
- Student selects Grade (only current grade + immediate next grade).
- Then selects Subject.
- Then sees Chapters as cards.
- Inside each chapter card, show three sections:
  Foundational / Skill Builder / Mastery
- Each worksheet is a row with:
  title, free/locked badge, download/view button, checkbox “Completed”
- Free/locked logic:
  - Worksheet marked free is always accessible.
  - Otherwise locked unless the student purchased the subject or an included package.
- Completed checkbox:
  - On click -> show polite honesty dialog -> confirm -> mark completed.
- Dashboard:
  - Show per-subject completion counts and % progress bar
  - Auto-updates when new worksheets are added (compute totals live).

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1) Identify models/relations in schema for:
   Grade, Subject, Chapter, Worksheet
   Completion tracking (WorksheetProgress/Completion)
   Purchases (Subject purchase + Package purchase)
2) Create protected pages under student route group:
   - /app/(student)/learn/worksheets/page.tsx (grade + subject selector)
   - /app/(student)/learn/worksheets/[subjectId]/page.tsx (chapter cards + worksheet lists)
   - /app/(student)/dashboard/page.tsx (progress summary)
3) Create API routes:
   - GET /api/worksheets/grades (returns allowed grades for user: current + next)
   - GET /api/worksheets/subjects?gradeId=...
   - GET /api/worksheets/subject/[subjectId] (chapters + worksheets + free/locked + completion status)
   - POST /api/worksheets/progress (toggle completed with confirmation)
4) Use the server-side requireUser() guard to protect these routes/pages.
5) Keep UI premium but minimal; reuse existing Card/Button/ProgressBar/Modal components.

Output:
- List of created files
- Confirm which Prisma models were used (actual names from schema)
- Confirm free/locked and completion logic works.
