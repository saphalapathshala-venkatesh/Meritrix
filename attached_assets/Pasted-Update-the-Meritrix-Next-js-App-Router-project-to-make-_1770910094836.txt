Update the Meritrix Next.js App Router project to make the navbar actions more premium and space-efficient.

GOALS (3 tasks):
1) In the Public navbar, place a “Create account” button to the LEFT of the “Login” button.
2) Replace the current Theme toggle (text-based) with a compact “color dot” theme switcher (two dots) so it uses minimal space:
   - Dot 1: Deep Teal (#0F5C5C) = default theme
   - Dot 2: Lavender (#5E5CE6)
   - Active theme must show a clear but subtle selection indicator (ring/border) that looks premium.
3) Apply the same dot-based theme switcher to StudentNavbar and AdminNavbar too (replace old ThemeToggle everywhere).
   - Public navbar right side order: ThemeDots, Create account, Login (Create account must be left of Login).
   - Student/Admin navbars: ThemeDots should be present in the right-side actions area, keeping spacing clean.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not change overall layout structure or styling system. Only update navbar action area + theme toggle component.
- Keep the UI premium: consistent spacing, no clutter, no loud colors, no text toggle.
- Use existing CSS variables and the existing data-theme mechanism on <html>.
- Persist theme choice in localStorage key "mx_theme".
- The theme toggle must set document.documentElement.dataset.theme = "teal" or "lavender".
- No auth logic yet; just placeholders.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
A) Create a new client component at: app/_components/ThemeDots.tsx
   - Render two small circular buttons (dots) with the two colors.
   - Clicking a dot updates data-theme and localStorage.
   - On mount, read localStorage and apply theme.
   - The active dot shows a subtle ring or border (using var(--ring) and/or var(--border)).

B) Update these files to use ThemeDots instead of ThemeToggle:
   - app/_components/PublicNavbar.tsx
   - app/_components/StudentNavbar.tsx
   - app/_components/AdminNavbar.tsx

C) Public navbar action area:
   - Right side should show (left → right): ThemeDots, Create account, Login
   - “Create account” should be a secondary-style button (surface background + border).
   - “Login” should be primary-style button (var(--primary) background).
   - Use consistent button sizing, padding, and rounded corners.

D) Add placeholder public routes so navbar links don’t 404:
   - app/(public)/login/page.tsx
   - app/(public)/signup/page.tsx
   Both pages can say “Coming soon” and mention auth will be implemented after Prisma.

E) Remove/stop using the old ThemeToggle component if it exists, or leave it unused but ensure navbars use ThemeDots.

After changes:
- Ensure TypeScript builds without errors.
- Ensure theme switching works on all layouts (/ , /dashboard, /admin).
- Ensure “Create account” appears left of “Login” in the public navbar.

Finally, output the list of modified/created files and show the final code for:
- app/_components/ThemeDots.tsx
- the updated navbar action section in PublicNavbar.tsx
- the placeholder login/signup page files
