Polish the existing Meritrix public homepage UI to meet premium spacing/alignment standards. Keep the same layout and tokens system. Only adjust styling and small component sizing.

TASKS:

1) Public Navbar overlap fix (brand + Home overlap)
- Ensure brand (Meritrix) and nav links never overlap.
- Use a proper responsive flex layout:
  - Left: Brand
  - Center: Nav links (hidden on small screens if needed)
  - Right: Theme dots + Create account + Login
- Add consistent horizontal spacing and prevent squishing:
  - Use `min-w-0`, `flex-1`, and `gap` properly
  - Brand should not wrap; nav links should not collide.

2) Theme dots sizing
- Reduce dot size so they never overlap any buttons.
- Make each dot ~18px (or smaller) with small ring when active.
- Keep dots in a compact container with gap 6–8px.

3) Create account button background
- Change Create account button from white to a mild deep-teal tint background (premium).
- Use: background = var(--primary-soft), text = var(--primary), border = transparent or var(--border).
- Keep it secondary style, NOT loud.

4) “3 feature cards” (Worksheets / Merit Drills / Live Sessions) alignment + two-tone card background
- Problem: text has vague gaps and looks loosely aligned.
- Fix:
  - Force consistent card internal layout with a grid/stack:
    - Icon row fixed height
    - Title row consistent
    - Body text consistent
  - Remove uneven spacing by using:
    - `gap-3` and consistent `leading-relaxed` or `leading-7`
    - Same padding for all cards
- Two-tone requirement:
  - Top part should remain white so icon stands out.
  - Below the icon (covering title + text area), apply a mild tinted background similar to the icon badge background.
  - So card should have:
    - Top strip (white): contains icon
    - Bottom area (tinted): contains title + text
- Implement this by wrapping the card body into two sections, e.g.:
  - `div` top with `bg-[var(--surface)]`
  - `div` bottom with `bg-[var(--primary-soft)]` (or a very light neutral teal tint)
- Make sure tint is subtle and premium.

5) Pricing buttons should all be dark (primary)
- On pricing cards section, make ALL CTA buttons use the same dark primary style:
  - bg var(--primary), text var(--on-primary)
- Remove “light” button style for Free/Team cards.

6) Context note
- Keep pricing cards content as placeholders; we will rewrite later. For now only update styling to look consistent and premium.

FILES TO EDIT:
- app/_components/ThemeDots.tsx (reduce dot size + spacing; ensure active ring looks clean)
- app/_components/PublicNavbar.tsx (fix overlap with proper flex + spacing; ensure right actions never collide)
- app/(public)/page.tsx (update feature cards to two-tone design + better alignment; update pricing button styles)

IMPORTANT:
- Do not add new pages or new features.
- Do not change the global token system.
- Keep typography premium: no pure black, consistent line height.
- Ensure everything looks aligned at common widths (desktop + small widths).

After changes:
- Show final code for:
  - ThemeDots.tsx
  - PublicNavbar.tsx (only navbar JSX)
  - Feature cards section JSX
  - Pricing buttons JSX
